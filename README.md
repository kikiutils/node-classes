## Classes

Detailed descriptions and examples can be found in the annotations within each class.

- [Path](./src/path.ts)
  - Provides a comprehensive wrapper around Node.js `path` and `fs` modules, and `fs-extra` library.
  - Immutable methods that return new instances with modified values.
  - Integration with `@kikiutils/fs-extra` for enhanced file system operations.

- [PrecisionNumber](./src/precision-number.ts)
  - Ensures accurate arithmetic operations with floating point numbers using the `Decimal.js` library.
  - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with high precision.
  - Includes methods for comparing numbers and checking states (e.g., finite, integer, zero).
  - In-place modification methods and immutable methods for flexible value manipulation.
